# COL226-assignments
Assignments for the course COL226 under Prof Sanjeeva Prasad, JAN-APRIL 2019
### 1) Assignment 0. A Bigint package
In this assignment, I wrote a BIGNUM package in OCaml where I implemented arithmetic for arbitrarily large numbers, using lists of digits to implement an integer.

### 2) Assignment 1: A simple definitional interpreter and stack machine
In this assignment, I modelled the "abstract syntax" of a simple calculator language for integer expressions, and give it "semantic meaning" in terms of OCaml's built-in types, and in the second part, implement the calculator as a simple stack-based machine, for which we have opcodes into which we compile the abstract syntax of an expression

### 3) Assignment 2: Building a scanner using OCaml-Lex
In this assignment, I created a lexer using Ocaml-lex
