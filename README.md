# COL226-assignments
Assignments for the course COL226 under Prof Sanjeeva Prasad, JAN-APRIL 2019
### 1) Assignment 0. A Bigint package
In this assignment, I wrote a BIGNUM package in OCaml where I implemented arithmetic for arbitrarily large numbers, using lists of digits to implement an integer.

### 2) Assignment 1: A simple definitional interpreter and stack machine
In this assignment, I modelled the "abstract syntax" of a simple calculator language for integer expressions, and give it "semantic meaning" in terms of OCaml's built-in types, and in the second part, implement the calculator as a simple stack-based machine, for which we have opcodes into which we compile the abstract syntax of an expression

### 3) Assignment 2: Building a scanner using OCaml-Lex
In this assignment, I created a lexer using Ocaml-lex

### 4) Assignment 3: Parsing for a simple expression evaluator
In this assignment, I designed a grammar for a simple expression language, taking care to enforce precedence rules (e.g., BODMAS). The language contain the following types of expressions:  `integers and booleans`

### 5) Assignment 4: Type-checking a functional language with Definitions and functions
Extended the language of Assignment 3 with definitions and first-class functions

### 6) Assignment 5: CBV and CBN Interpreters for a tiny functional language
In this assignment I implemented **krivine** machine (call by name) and the **SECD** machine (call by value for a tiny functional language)

### 7) Assignment 6: A simulator for nested procedure calls
In this assignment I implemented the core ideas (not the actual layout for any given architecture or language/compiler, and not the actual code generation) for understanding implementations of the (static/lexical) scoping discipline in Algol-like languages, particularly the visibility rules and the set-up/tear-down involved in procedure call and return
